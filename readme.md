#Info:
1. Linux and MacOs already have python preinstalled but still in case:
* Install python3 (Linux):   https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/
* Install python3 (MacOS):   https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/

2. You don't need to install any module. All modules used are included in the standard library (since Python 2.5).

3. I have included 3 files
* main.py : Driver code
* parkingLot.py: includes parking class
* testcase : contains testcase (first command should be create parking)

4. To run (MacOS/Linux)
* % git clone https://github.com/turkarshreyash/SquadStack_Assign
* % cd SquadStack_Assign
* % python3 main.py testCase1.txt
